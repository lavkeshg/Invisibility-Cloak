# Invisibility-Cloak

## About
If you have watched Harry Potter you must know what invisibility cloak is. Well, it turns out that you can create this magical experience using an image processing technique called color detection and segmentation. And the good news is, you don’t need to be part of Hogwarts for that! All you need is a Red colored cloth and follow this repository. This code turns a red colour cloth into an invisibility cloak.
<ul>
  <li>It's a fun application which you will enjoy using.</li>
  <li>You can learn some key functions of opencv from this project.</li>
</ul>

## How it works?
<ol>
  <li>Capture and store the background frame.</i>
  <li>Detect the red colored cloth using color detection algorithm.</li>
  <li>Segment out the red colored cloth by generating a mask.</li>
  <li>Generate the final augmented output to create the magical effect.</li>
</ol>
